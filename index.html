            <h2 class="secHeading">A Fun Trip!</h2>
            <p class="text">
                Last year after my semesters were over, I was bored to the core. Had nothing to do, but my parents came
                up with a plan. They planned a trip to Darjeeling, The Queen of Hills, and Sikkim, The garden of God Of
                War, Indra (also known as Indrakil). So we packed our bags and left in the month of April. I must say it
                was a very exciting and adventurous trip, we had a lot of fun there. We saw monks for the first time,
                also got to see a Red Panda (it is an endangered species). The tea gardens were awesome and the weather
                was clement. I also played with snow for the very first time!!! I had never seen a snowfall or played
                with snow before. And yeah, I also got over my fear of height, I tried Zip-Lining!!! We were really
                exhausted by the end, but it was indeed a really good trip and worth remembering.
                <br><br>
                Here, I will be sharing some of the best places I visited there. If you are planning a trip and cannot
                think of a destination, I'll suggest you come to Darjeeling and Sikkim, and you'll never forget this
                place ever!!! Hope it helps!!!

            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Tiger Hill is a mountain located in Darjeeling. It has a panoramic view of Mount Everest and Mount
                Kanchenjunga together. It is 11 kilometres from the town of Darjeeling and can be reached either by jeep
                or by foot through Chowrasta, Alubari or Jorebangla and then climbing up the incline to the summit. At
                sunrise, the peaks of Kanchenjunga are illuminated before the sun is seen at lower elevations. From
                Tiger Hill, Mount Everest, Makalu and Lhotse are just visible. Kanchenjunga looks higher than Mt.
                Everest, as it is several miles closer than Everest. The magnificent view of snow-capped mountains
                sitting amidst cotton clouds attracts tourists to Tiger Hill from all over the country.
                <br><br>
                The starting time from Darjeeling is 3.30 AM to reach Tiger Hill by 4.15 AM The starting time becomes
                4.15 AM in winters due to delayed sunrise time. The roads get blocked by a convoy of jeeps and cars
                during the peak season. To get up to the sunrise spot, it requires a short climb on foot from the
                parking spot. One can book a car or an Innova from a travel agency in the city or pay &#8377 200 per
                head.

                <h2 class="place">TEA GARDENS</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Darjeeling is known to be home to some of the best tea estates in the world. The UNESCO world heritage
                site boasts acres of resplendent meadows that also serve as the perfect tourist attraction. The history
                of the tea gardens can be traced back to 1852 when Darjeeling was only a tiny hamlet and was used as a
                hill resort by the British officials and their families. The British started planting tea leaves here
                and to gather manpower, labor was hired even from across the Nepal border. Gradually the business took
                shape and in 1866 alone, there were 39 flourishing tea estates. In 1870, the number increased to 56, and
                eventually, Darjeeling became one of the best tea-producing estates in the country.
                <br><br>
                Nature Walks in the resplendent tea gardens is the most loved activity when in Darjeeling. You can
                engage with the workers and help them pluck teas. Or you can go to the factories and watch the making of
                these fine tea powders. Or better still, pick up some to take it back home with you to relish a little
                piece of Darjeeling in the humdrum of life. There are many tea gardens in Dargeeling, all of them being
                beautiful and serene. You can visit any of them, according to your itinerary.

            <p class="text">
                While Darjeeling is the producer of the best teas in the world, it is also a great place where you can
                drink or taste a cup of tea made from the leaves freshly plucked from one of its renowned gardens and
                even buy some of the finest packaged tea. There are many tea factory outlets and tea lounges in
                Darjeeling town where you can drink a cup of black, green, Oolong or white tea while you enjoy the
                mountain views and learn about the tea types, their flavors and grades from the outlet owner. And then

                <br><br>
                Packaged Darjeeling tea from Darjeeling hills is one of the prized souvenirs that very few tourists like
                to miss. And there are some Darjeeling teas that you will get only here at the factory outlets and no
                where else in India. So you won't get that anywhere in the country unless you buy them directly from the
                factory outlet.

                <h2 class="place">TSOMGO LAKE</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Tsomgo Lake, also known as Tsongmo Lake or Changu Lake, is a glacial lake in the East Sikkim district of
                the Indian state of Sikkim, some 40 kilometres from the capital Gangtok. Located at an elevation of
                3,753 m, the lake remains frozen during the winter season. The lake surface reflects different colours
                with change of seasons and is held in great reverence by the local Sikkimese people. Buddhist monks
                predicted after studying the changing colours of the lake. This is one of the few and awesome high
                altitude lakes in India. The lake becomes doubly attractive with the reflections of the surrounding
                hills on the water. From Gangtok which is at 5410 ft, the altitude rises to about 10,000 ft in just
                15kms. You can imagine how steep the gradient would be on this stretch of the road.
                <br><br>
                Tourist attractions at the lake site include joy rides on decorated yaks and mules where kiosks offer
                variety of food and drinks. There is also a small Shiva temple on the bank of the lake. As the lake is
                located in a restricted area it is essential for all Indians visiting the area to obtain permits. In
                case of foreign nationals special permit is essential.

                <h2 class="place">BABA HARBHAJAN SINGH TEMPLE</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Located between Nathula and Jelepla pass at an altitude of 13,123 ft and about 52kms from Gangtok, Baba
                Harbhajan Singh Temple is a unique destination mainly due to the legacy attached with it. It is believed
                that his spirit protects every soldier in the inhospitable high-altitude terrain of the Eastern
                Himalayas. The legend of Baba goes back 35 years when Sepoy Harbhajan Singh of the 23rd Punjab Regiment
                went missing. A manhunt was launched and it took the army three days to find his body. It is believed
                that he himself led the soldiers to the site. The soldiers raised a Samadhi in his name and till date
                people in the area believe that Baba’s sprit protects the soldier posted here. The Indian Army treated
                Baba as a soldier who never died and he was retired with full honours in December 2016.
                <br><br>
                April to November is the best time to visit Baba Harbhajan Singh Memorial Temple in Sikkim. The weather
                during these months remains pleasant, and you can comfortably pay your respects to the soldier Harbhajan
                Singh. You cannot be able to access Baba Harbhajan Singh Temple in winter as the Nathula Pass is blocked
                by heavy snowfall. There is no entry fee to visit the Baba Harbhajan Singh Temple.

                <h2 class="place">NAMCHI</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Namchi or Namtse is the capital of the district of South Sikkim in the Indian state of Sikkim. The
                appellation Namchi means Sky (Nam) High (Chi) in Sikkimese. Namchi is situated at an altitude of 1,675 m
                above sea level. It is situated at a distance of 78 kilometres from the state capital Gangtok and 100
                kilometres from the town of Siliguri. Namchi lies off the road between Melli and Jorethang. Namchi is
                well connected to other towns in Sikkim and West Bengal. Jeeps and buses regularly ply between Namchi to
                Gangtok, Pelling, Jorethang, Kalimpong and Siliguri. Historically, Namchi was the place where Pende
                Ongmoo, the treacherous princess who poisoned one of the Chogyals of Sikkim, was caught and killed for
                her deed. Legend says her spirit still haunts the foothills of Ghurpisey.
                <br><br>
                The small town, Namchi is the epitome of culture, diversity, religion, benevolence, and also depicts the
                munificence of Sikkim. Namchi is blessed with welcoming monasteries, traditional temples, lush greenery,
                flora, and forests. On a tour to Namchi, tourists can unveil the best kept secrets of the Himalaya. The
                beauty of Namchi can't be defined in a single word or phrase.
